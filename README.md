==================

<<<<<<< HEAD
Simple MIDI out code that sends control messages to MIDI controllers using the OSX CoreMIDI framework.
The data can be seen using a MIDI monitors or by attaching MIDI devices that visually show note or control output, such as the Novation Launchpad or Livid Code of this project is tested on.
Made as a simple example to help others when starting to use the CoreMIDI framework.
